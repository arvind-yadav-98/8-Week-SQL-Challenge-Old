## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
